                    <span>Internationally recognized degrees</span>
                    <p>Universities in the UK, Italy, and Netherlands, are all well-known for the excellent quality of education and practical skills that they provide. Many organisations, even apart from those in these countries, value the degrees obtained from these institutions. This can be very crucial and can make a huge difference when applying for jobs and searching for placements in the entirety of Europe.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="why_abroad_point">
                    <span>Shorter duration of courses</span>
                    <p>Undergraduate courses in Europe often last for no more than three years, as opposed to the four-year courses in colleges in the United States. As a result, the programmes are less time-consuming and more cost-effective for all of the students that attend. Furthermore, several colleges there provide a one-year work internship in the industry too, which can help you improve your practical abilities, and gain crucial work experience. As for postgraduate programs, they can be as short as just lasting for a single year, while also teaching you everything that's important during that period.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="why_abroad_point">
                    <span>Great infrastructure and a vast assortment of subjects to select from</span>
                    <p>Education infrastructure is a critical component of the university learning setting. High-quality infrastructure, among other things, promotes better education, increases student results, and lowers dropout rates, according to credible data. This is omnipresent in all universities in Europe, especially in the UK, Italy, and Netherlands. Additionally, as mentioned above, you can select any subject that you are passionate about there and catch your dreams.</p>
