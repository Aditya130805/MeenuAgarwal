            Career counselling is much more than just securing admission.
        </div>
        <div class="sectionText">
            I firmly believe in true career guidance — not just 'admissions into universities'. I take pride in personally counselling every student, taking the time to deeply understand their aspirations and guiding them towards choices that genuinely align with their goals. I never delegate this responsibility to colleagues or assistants, because I know how important this trust is. My greatest satisfaction comes not from simply helping a student secure admission, but from watching them thrive in their careers and knowing I played a meaningful role in their success.
